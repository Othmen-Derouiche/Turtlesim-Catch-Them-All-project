# Turtlesim-Catch-Them-All-project

If you want to go further you can, for example:

- Make the new turtles move randomly. You will then need to be able to keep an eye on each turtle,
  and thus dynamically create a subscription for each alive turtle’s pose!
  For that you can create a “middle” node whose goal is to monitor the playground,
  and tell the turtle controller where to go at any given time.

- Change the pen color each time the “master turtle” has caught another turtle.
- Add another “master turtle” node to catch turtles even faster!
